react-material is where all of the client side code refactoring is happening

The server just exists to serve up the files while developing. The eventual app will be firebase based, which allows for embedding of database access directly in the front-end, so it'll never be connected to a specific server.

Currently the app has no connectivity to firebase. Currently skeleton-ing out the front end and establishing local versions of data handling.

to start:`
npm install
npm run react-dev
npm run server-dev
visit localhost:3000
